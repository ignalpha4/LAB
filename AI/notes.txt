Both the backtracking and branch and bound approaches are used to solve the N-Queens problem, but they differ in their implementation.

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that is used to solve many problems, including the N-Queens problem. It works by recursively exploring all possible solutions until a solution is found or until it is determined that no solution exists. In the case of the N-Queens problem, the backtracking algorithm works by recursively trying to place queens on the chessboard and undoing the placement if it leads to a conflict.

Branch and bound is a more specialized technique that is used to solve optimization problems. In the case of the N-Queens problem, the branch and bound algorithm works by exploring the search space of possible solutions in a systematic way, using an upper bound on the number of queens that can be placed on the chessboard without conflict. The algorithm keeps track of the best solution found so far and prunes the search space whenever it can be shown that the current branch cannot lead to a better solution than the best one found so far.

The backtracking approach typically explores all possible solutions before finding the correct one, while the branch and bound approach is more efficient and can find the solution more quickly by pruning the search space. However, the branch and bound approach requires a heuristic or upper bound to guide the search, while the backtracking approach does not. Additionally, the branch and bound approach can be more complex to implement than the backtracking approach.
